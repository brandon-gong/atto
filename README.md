Atto is a desktop application for browsing the web with an extremely poor connection.  To do so, Atto strips away all CSS, JavaScript, custom fonts, etc. from a website and displays the website content in an extremely minimal Markdown format in plain, simple, legible text.  

Additionally, Atto itself is built to be downloadable under extremely poor connection, and aims to keep as small of a footprint as possible by leaving out unnecessary features such as tabs, browsing history, etc. and focusing purely on the quality and efficiency of the key features that are included.  Atto is written in C++, meaning highly optimized and compact software without having to download any bulky runtimes such as Python or Java.

## Disclaimer
This project is purely a personal exploration of mine, and though it will be functional I doubt it will be faster, because it relies on connection to my own server, which probably won't work very well for people outside the United States.  I'm working on this project purely as a challenge to myself to see how small and efficient I can keep the code.  Speed and space efficiency hasn't really been a concern of mine ever (I've done apps in React Native, and written Electron apps and Python scripts) so this will be a huge learning process for me.

Is this project done? No.  Will it ever be?  Probably not.  But my goal is to make it not only a learning experience for me, but also a resource that others can draw and learn from as well.
